# Book-Entry-System
**INTRODUCTION**<br>
BOOK ENTRY SYSTEM is a system which maintains the storage of book 
data in the database. Owing to the advancement of technology, organization of Book Entry 
System becomes much simple. The Book Entry system has been designed to computerize and 
automate the operations performed over the information about the Books in the database. This 
computerization of book entry helps in many instances of its maintenances. It will provide user friendly environment, which is very easy to 
work with. Management of various books is incorporated in the library and will deliver the 
required information in a very easy to access manner. The software has been developed keeping 
in mind easy modifications and enhancement that may be required from time to time<br><br> 
**Modules-**<br>
* _Admin login_: Admin is the one who administers the system by adding or removing the 
books into and from the system respectively.<br> 
* _Encrypt Data_: The admin adds the books by encrypting the data in the database.<br>
* _View Books_: Admin can view the books by decrypting it from the database.<br><br> 
**OBJECTIVES**<br> 
  The main objective of this project is to computerize the manual system & reduce the time 
consumption. In other words, we can say that our project has the following objectives: - <br> 
 
1. Making the Book Entry System computerized.<br>  
2. Reduce time consumption. <br> 
3. Reduce error scope. <br> 
4. Paper work is reduced as we need not to maintain registers for future references.<br>
**SYSTEM REQUIREMENT** <br>
1) _Hardware Requirement_: 
The hardware facilities which are required in order to cope up with the proposed 
systems are as follows:
1. One Pentium / Celeron Processor computer. 
3. One inkjet / laser printer. 
2) _Software Requirement_: 
The minimum software requirements for the proposed system would be- 
1. Windows 7, 8.1, 10 Operating System. 
2. PHP (Hypertext Pre-processor) with HTML for front end, My SQL for back 
end and WAMP, XAMPP as web server of the proposed system.
